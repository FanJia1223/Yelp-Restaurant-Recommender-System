# Yelp-Restaurant-Recommender-System
#### Yelp dataset challenge

### Being one of the most popular local recommendation app, Yelp can provide important information based on thousands of user reviews. We would like to further improve the functionality of Yelp by providing restaurant recommendations to users based on their preferences.

#### We have developped user-user similarity, restaurant-restaurant similarity, and random forest models to recommend which restaurants a user may like.
